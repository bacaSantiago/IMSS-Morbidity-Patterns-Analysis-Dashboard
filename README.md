## Overview

This project presents an advanced web-based dashboard developed using Dash, Plotly, and other state-of-the-art Python libraries. The dashboard focuses on analyzing and visualizing epidemiological data from multiple health datasets in Mexico, including COVID-19, Dengue, Febrile Diseases, and Morbidity data. By leveraging powerful statistical techniques, clustering algorithms, and machine learning models, this application provides insights into health trends, comorbidity relationships, and classification tasks related to patient outcomes.

The dashboard integrates interactive visualizations, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, making it an essential tool for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare providers to understand disease patterns and improve decision-making.

## Features

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **COVID-19 Dataset:**
  - Age and gender distributions.
  - Temporal trends in COVID-19 case classifications.
  - Geospatial analysis of cases by state.
  - Heatmaps showcasing comorbidity relationships.
  - Analysis of symptoms-to-admission intervals.
- **Dengue Dataset:**
  - Gender-wise age distributions.
  - Trends in dengue cases over time.
  - Proportions of hemorrhagic vs. non-hemorrhagic dengue cases.
  - Comorbidity co-occurrence heatmaps.
- **Febrile Diseases Dataset:**
  - Parallel categories visualization of complications, vaccination, and mortality.
  - Geospatial distribution of cases.
- **Morbidity Dataset:**
  - Temporal trends in the top 10 diseases.
  - Treemap analysis of diseases by state.
  - Geospatial heatmaps of disease prevalence.

### 2. **Statistical Analysis**

- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):**
  - Comparing age distributions across datasets (COVID-19, Dengue, and Febrile Diseases).
- **MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance):**
  - Comparing comorbidities across datasets (e.g., COVID-19 vs. Dengue).
  - Analyzing differences in comorbidities between ambulatory and hospitalized patients.

### 3. **Clustering Analysis**

- **K-Means Clustering:**
  - Applied to numerical variables to group dengue cases.
- **K-Prototypes Clustering:**
  - Applied to mixed-type data (numerical and categorical) in febrile diseases.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:**
  - Applied to COVID-19 data using Ward‚Äôs method.
- **Time-Series Clustering:**
  - Clustering morbidity data to uncover temporal patterns.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
  - Dimensionality reduction applied to COVID-19 and morbidity datasets.

### 4. **Classification Models**

- **Logistic Regression:**
  - Predicting patient type (ambulatory vs. hospitalized) based on comorbidities in the COVID-19 dataset.
- **Gradient Boosting:**
  - Predicting PCR test results in dengue cases.
- **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA):**
  - Predicting mortality in dengue cases using demographic and medical data.
